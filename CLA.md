By contributing to the ShipOS project, you agree to the following terms and conditions for your present and future Contributions submitted to ShipOS. Except for the license granted herein to ShipOS and recipients of software distributed by ShipOS, you reserve all right, title, and interest in and to your Contributions.

## 1. Definitions

- **"Contribution"** shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to ShipOS for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by ShipOS (the **"Work"**). For the purposes of this definition, **"submitted"** means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to ShipOS or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, ShipOS for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as **"Not a Contribution"**.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to ShipOS and to recipients of software distributed by ShipOS a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to ShipOS and to recipients of software distributed by ShipOS a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

1. **All Contributions become the exclusive property of ShipOS.** Upon submission, You transfer and assign to ShipOS all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions, including all copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights.

2. **ShipOS retains exclusive ownership.** ShipOS shall be the sole and exclusive owner of all Contributions, including all past, present, and future Contributions made by You to the ShipOS project.

3. **ShipOS has full control.** ShipOS may, at its sole discretion:
   - Close the repository or make it private
   - Prohibit distribution of the Work
   - Sell, license, or otherwise commercialize the Work
   - Modify, remove, or reject any Contribution
   - Change the license terms of the Work
   - Take any other action with respect to the Work

4. **No contributor rights.** You acknowledge that:
   - You have no right to require ShipOS to keep the repository open or public

If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to ShipOS.

3. Each of Your Contributions fully complies with applicable export laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions.

4. You have not violated, and will not violate, any third party's copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property rights.
