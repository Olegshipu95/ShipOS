          Before we can review and merge your pull request, you need to sign our [Contributor Assignment Agreement](CONTRIBUTOR_ASSIGNMENT.md).
          
          ### 📋 What is the Contributor Assignment Agreement?
          
          The Contributor Assignment Agreement ensures that all contributions to ShipOS become the exclusive property of the project owner. This allows ShipOS to:
          - Maintain exclusive ownership of all code
          - Control distribution and licensing
          - Commercialize the project if desired
          
          ### ✍️ How to Sign
          
          1. **Read the Contributor Assignment Agreement:** Please carefully read the [CONTRIBUTOR_ASSIGNMENT.md](CONTRIBUTOR_ASSIGNMENT.md) document
          2. **Sign via CLA Assistant:** If you have the CLA Assistant app installed, it will prompt you automatically
          3. **Manual Signing:** If CLA Assistant is not available, please comment on this PR with:
             \`\`\`
             I have read the CONTRIBUTOR_ASSIGNMENT.md and agree to its terms. I hereby sign the Contributor Assignment Agreement.
             \`\`\`
          
          ### ⚠️ Important
          
          By signing the Contributor Assignment Agreement, you agree that:
          - All your contributions (past, present, and future) become the exclusive property of ShipOS
          - ShipOS has full rights to use, modify, distribute, and commercialize your contributions
          - You grant ShipOS all necessary rights and licenses
          
          Once you've signed, this check will be updated automatically.
